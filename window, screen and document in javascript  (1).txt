Read about the difference between window, screen and document in javascript

WINDOW :-

Each browser tab has its own top-level window object. Each <iframe> (and deprecated <frame>) element has its own window object too, 
nested within a parent window. Each of these windows gets its own separate global object. window.window always refers to window, but
window.parent and window.top might refer to enclosing windows, giving access to other execution contexts. In addition to document 
and screen described below, window properties include,

1. SetTimeout() and setInterval() binding event handlers to a timer.
2. Location giving the current URL.
3. History with methods back() and forward() giving the tab's mutable history.
4. Navigator describing the browser software.


DOCUMENT :-

Each window object has a document object to be rendered. These objects get confused in part because HTML elements are added to the 
global object when assigned a unique id. E.g., in the HTML snippet :
{ 
<body>
  <p id="holyCow"> This is the first paragraph.</p>
</body>
}

The paragraph element can be referenced by any of the following :-
1. window.holyCow or window["holyCow"].
2. document.getElementById("holyCow").
3. document.querySelector("#holyCow").
4. document.body.firstChild.
5. document.body.children[0].

SCREEN :-

The window object also has a screen object with properties describing the physical display:

1. Screen properties width and height are the full screen.
2. Screen properties availWidth and availHeight omit the toolbar.

The portion of a screen displaying the rendered document is the viewport in JavaScript, which is potentially confusing because 
we call an application's portion of the screen a window when talking about interactions with the operating system. 
The getBoundingClientRect() method of any document element will return an object with top, left, bottom, and right properties 
describing the location of the element in the viewport.
