The For Loop :-

The For Loop comes first because of its simplicity and ease of use. It is a very user-friendly kind of loop that runs with a method 
of using a counter. 

The value is first set with an appropriate condition, which is also called ‘initializing a loop’. Next, the terminal or final 
value is specified. The For Loop makes things really easy when you need to run a set of codes multiple times.

The For Loop is further divided into :-
1. Using an array
2. Making a loop through DOM elements


The For In Loop :-

Another way of looping is the For In Loop. Unlike the For Loop, this loop won’t be using a counter. So this makes the whole process 
even more simple and hassle-free. In fact, the For In Loop is essentially a simplified version of the For Loop.

The following are different ways of looping using the For In technique :-
1. Looping through an Object Property.

The ForEach Loop :-

JSON forEach tutorial shows how to loop over a JSON array in JavaScript. In this tutorial we use JSON server to handle test data.
The json-server is a JavaScript library to create testing REST API.
First, we create a project directory an install the json-server module.

1. mkdir jsonforeach
2. cd jsonforeach
3. npm init -y
4. npm i -g json-server


The ForIn Loop :-

The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects, including: built-in String, Array, array-like objects
(e.g., arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables. It invokes a custom iteration hook with statements
to be executed for the value of each distinct property of the object.

1. Variable:
On each iteration a value of a different property is assigned to variable. variable may be declared with const, let, or var.

2. Iterable:
Object whose iterable properties are iterated.
Syntax-
for (variable of iterable) {
  statement
}
